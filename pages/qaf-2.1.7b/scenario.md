Scenario consist of meta-data and sequence of steps to represents a single test case.
Each step can be started with standard BDD keywords.

## List of available keywords.

|keywords|
|-------|
|Given| 
|When|
|Then|
|And|
|Having|

## Structure 

```
Scenario: <Name of the Scenario>
 
Meta-data: {<meta-key>:<meta-value>[,<meta-key>:<meta-value>]}
 
[Keyword] <first step description with parameters>
 
â€¦
 
 [Keyword] <nth step description>
 
End
```
Want to iterate with set of test data from file? You got it with data-driven Scenario. 

## Meta-data 

* There are predefined meta-key available to use which are list in table below.
* You can define your custom meta-key to categorize scenarios as per AUT. You can choose whatever names are most appropriate for the information they are trying to convey.
